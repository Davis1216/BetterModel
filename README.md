### Lightweight BlockBench model engine & entity animation
This plugin implements the server-side model by using an item-display packet.

- Importing Generic BlockBench model (.bbmodel)
- Auto-generating resource pack
- Playing animation
- Syncing with base entity
- Custom hit box
- Supports 12-limb player animation

### Why do I create BetterModel even though ModelEngine already exists?
The main reason I created it is:
- To reduce traffic usage—MEG’s traffic optimization is outdated and insufficient for modern servers.
- To enable faster updates—We can’t afford to wait for MEG’s slow update cycle anymore.
- To provide a more flexible API—MEG is closed-source with a very limited API, which makes extending or integrating difficult.
- To restore vanilla behavior-MEG breaks several vanilla entity features and physics, which this project aims to fix.

### Summary
![1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/397a1ff3-37f2-4e3a-9868-732d3a044c4c)  
This plugin, of course, implements a Generic BlockBench model with animation.  

### Network optimization
![3](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6c421f33-682e-4674-a5d2-13310e5dbbfe)  
This plugin can optimize network by **sight-trace**. It won't send packets when the player's not looking.  

### Multiple hit-box
![4](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dc311327-1212-4889-a6c8-dd71cc8f2c8b)  
![5](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0fc3250d-ef4f-4e64-9cc2-c143a474d046)  
This plugin provides multiple hit-box both client and server. (tracking animation rotation)

### MythicMobs support
![6](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/06804f8c-af0d-46ce-adff-b868b65ba44a)  
![7](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d2f7e69f-dce1-4fa6-84cd-83b35560a0b4)  
Like MEG, This plugin implements simple MythicMobs support.
